*Try to be as clear as possible: Is it fixing/adding something in the model? Is it an additional test/function/dataset? PLEASE DELETE THIS LINE.*

**I hereby confirm that I have:**

- [ ] Tested my code with [all requirements](https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/yeast-GEM#required-software---contributor) for running the model
- [ ] Selected `devel` as base branch (top left drop-down menu)
- [ ] If the `.xml` file changed, checked that the new file is a valid SBML object at http://sbml.org/validator (i.e. no errors, warnings are fine)
- [ ] If needed, asked first in the [Gitter chat room](https://gitter.im/SysBioChalmers/yeast-GEM) about this PR

*Note: replace [ ] with [X] to check the box. PLEASE DELETE THIS LINE*
