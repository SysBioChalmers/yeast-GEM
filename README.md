# The consensus genome-scale metabolic model of _Saccharomyces cerevisiae_

This repository contains the continuously updated consensus genome-scale metabolic model of _Saccharomyces cerevisiae_. This is a community effort, continuing the [yeastnet](https://sourceforge.net/projects/yeast/) project, and since 2018 known as `yeast-GEM`. The development of `yeast-GEM` is versioned and tracked in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/yeast-GEM), which enables reproducible, collaborative and open science.

## Download the latest version [![Current release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/SysBioChalmers/yeast-GEM/all.svg)](https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/yeast-GEM/releases/)

The [latest version](https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/yeast-GEM/releases/latest) of `yeast-GEM` can be downloaded as a [**ZIP file**](https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/yeast-GEM/zipball/main), while previous versions (7.6.0 and newer) are also still [available](https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/yeast-GEM/releases). You are typically encouraged to use the latest version, as it will have known bugs fixed and represent the latest knowledge in _S. cerevisiae_ metabolism.

## Clone or fork the repository
To enjoy the full capabilities of `yeast-GEM` and its tracked development on GitHub, you should not download the ZIP file, but instead **clone** or **fork** the `yeast-GEM` [repository](https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/yeast-GEM). If you are not familiar with git, GitHub and its terminology, you can look at this [quickstart](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git) and/or this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IE_w8TdmwUE).

Note: if you want to make contributions to `yeast-GEM` (see below) it is essential to clone or fork the repository.

## Installation and usage instructions
Instructions on how to use the model (including [load/save](https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/yeast-GEM?tab=readme-ov-file#model-usage) in MATLAB or Python) are available [here](https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/yeast-GEM?tab=readme-ov-file#installation--usage), and also detailed under _Installation & usage_ in the `README.md` that can be found in the yeast-GEM ZIP-file (if downloaded instead of cloned).
